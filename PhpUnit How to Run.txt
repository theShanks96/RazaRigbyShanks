1. Change requires for the PhpUnit Tests

At the top of every test there will be a series of require_once statements that link the test to the relevant files.
require_once '../../coursework/smsSeeker/app/src/SanitisedValidator.php';
require_once '../../coursework/smsSeeker/app/settings.php';

2. Run the PhpUnit Test

Change the dir to where the phpunit file is such as: 
C:> cd ./xampp/htdocs/vendor/bin/

Then run to run all the tests:
C:\xampp\htdocs\CTEC3110\vendor\bin>phpunit --bootstrap ../../vendor/autoload.php ../../../CTEC3110/coursework/smsSeeker/app/tests

To specify a single test merely extend the above command with something along the lines of: 
{previous_command}/SanitisedValidatorTest
